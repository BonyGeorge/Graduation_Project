

what is wild oat?
why can't people differiniate between wild oat and wheat?

what will happen if wild oat spread?

what are their disadvantages?

how are you planning to get it?

-------------------------------------
Expected results:

I am gonna talk about expected results for our project 
First Recognition : When our model is ready and trained ,
it will be able to classify between the wild oat and wheat
in early stage.
DEtection: Our model will be embedded in a Raspberry Pi which
is connected toa camera module which will be detecting 
the wild oat using real-time camera recording which is new
because other similar sysytem they use photographed images.

Impurities in wheat seriously affect wheat quality and food
security.  To solve the 
recognition and classification problems associated with 
impurities in wheat,a recognition method using 
an improved convolutional neural network 
In this paper, developed six datasets of named pictures 
of wheat, to be specific ordinary wheat, bugs, grass, stalks, 
spikelets, and awns of wheat. The preparation set was made out
of 25,200 pictures and the approval set comprised of 10,800 
pictures. Based on network research using Inception_v3, 
improvement and optimization are
undertaken before designing the WheNet convolutional neural 
network, which is intended for automatic recognition of wheat
images.Experimental results indicate that the WheNet network 
achieved the most efficient results. It also shows a
shorter training time, and its recognition accuracies for 
Top_1 and Top_5 of the test set are 98.59% and 99.98%, 
respectively. this method can be used to detect impurities
 in other fields.
